# GoodReads_Project

### Purpose of this project : 

This project has as main objective to make a deep statistical analysis on the dataset GoodReads which contains data coming from the famous website where users can rate and give reviews about the books they read. The goal here is to use the different tools of Data Analytics and Machine Learning in order to analyze the key factors that play a role in the rating of a book. We have to consider all the variables in order to make a good prediction, and thus a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis is crucial because it will help us explore the different key factors that might explain the reasons behind the rating of a user. 

This Notebook will have all the necessary steps that help acheive this goal, among these steps are : 
- Data processing 
- Data cleaning 
- EDA
- Feature selection 
- Model training 

The project uses some important Python libraries that are included in the requirements.txt. The dataset is publically available on this website : https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home.
